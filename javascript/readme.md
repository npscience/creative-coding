Domestika course: Creative Coding with Javascript ~ by Bruno Imbrizi

Started Feb 2022

## Unit 2
1. Draw a grid of rectangles, randomness every refresh

- raw code: ~ with my notes, includes various unnecessary bits while I was learning
- tidy code: ~ removing the extraneous, not used to create vide but tested (it works)
- video:  ~ no audio, i'm hitting refresh every second
