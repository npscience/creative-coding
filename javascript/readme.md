Domestika course: Creative Coding with Javascript ~ by Bruno Imbrizi

Started Feb 2022

## Unit 2
1. Draw a grid of rectangles, randomness every refresh

- [raw code](/hello.html) ~ with my notes, includes various unnecessary bits while I was learning
- [tidy code](/random-rects.html) ~ removing the extraneous notes
- [video of result](/random-squares-on-refresh.mov) ~ no audio, i'm hitting refresh every second
- GIF of result
