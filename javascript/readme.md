Domestika course: Creative Coding with Javascript ~ by Bruno Imbrizi

Started Feb 2022

## Unit 2
1. Draw a grid of rectangles, randomness every refresh

- raw code: /hello.html ~ with my notes, includes various unnecessary bits while I was learning
- tidy code: /random-rects.html ~ removing the extraneous, not used to create vide but tested (it works)
- video: /random-squares-on-refresh.mov ~ no audio, i'm hitting refresh every second
